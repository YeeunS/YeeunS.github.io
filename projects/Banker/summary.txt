Based on the project1, fixing errors regarding  segmentation fault, it seems that the project 2
runs successfully with C++. In the same case of the project1, when I just put a or ad, the add option was instructed for user to input the account number. After adding account numbers, names, and address, it prints descending orders. The previous project had some issues when adding records in empty list, as well as it brought segmentation fault when adding records. Those are fixed properly, running program without errors. Additionally, I also overloaded the operator to copy the data from another llist. And, I also overloaded the << operator to write a std::ostream so that it prints the contents of the entire database, and replaces the function call of printAllRecords in the user-interface. Overall, project 2 runs appropriately, and for the future, I hope to focus on writing the code concisely and effectively. Since when I print the records, it seems to be non-organized. Based on these projects, I can improve some functions to be constructed better than what I did.
