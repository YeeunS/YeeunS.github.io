<h2 id="coding-grammar">Coding Grammar</h2>

<p>Coding standards are a set of frameworks or guidelines for a specific programming language that suggests its styles and methods. They give a uniform appearance to the codes written by different software engineers, and also they may reduce complexity. I believe that the reason coding standards are accompanied among software engineers is that it improves readability by giving a guarantee of a common look and feel to code regardless of who wrote it. I can say that coding standards role as “a grammar checker” for us to detect and remove basic mistakes associated with a language or library.</p>

<h2 id="key-as-a-communication">Key as a Communication</h2>

<p>Having a new entry on ESLint with IntelliJ, as an intermediate  of software engineering, this past week has given me a first experience on how I could adjust coding standards. Throwing back to what I learned in programming, I used to accept different standards since I didn’t have particular personal rules when building a code. But, red warnings regarding spacing errors and my syntax errors led up to realization that I stick to my own styles, and it could be expanded to consider that coding standards are the strong tools for communication.</p>

<h2 id="dont-be-afraid">Don’t be Afraid</h2>

<p>All in all, those marks, regardless of green or red color, using ESLint makes me feel frustrated and it requires me to catch the errors even in small details. At the very beginning of getting familiar with ESLint with IntelliJ, I was not confident if I could get into this IDE. Yet, whenever I practice and play with it, it improves my quality of technique on programming. Personally, I wish I had learned it before starting this ICS314 class so that I could systematize my coding style following gerneralized coding styles. I could enjoy the integration with Github Desktop which can push and pull my repositories directly. I expect to further utlize those platforms to enhance the quality of my programming with coding standards.</p>
