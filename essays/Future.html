<h2 id="pre-start">Pre-Start</h2>

<p>It is irresistible to borrow my personal background and it might be an appropriate starting point to describe my journey. I followed a social science path to get a bachelor’s degree in art science, especially psychology in Korea. And this degree was a base for the higher level of my education to achieve a doctoral degree. Following up the studying, I started losing my confidence in whether I can achieve my ultimate goal, so I sought to find other ways with open-minded possibilities. After transferring to UHM, it was challenging to enter a totally different field which is computer science. My journey to software engineering just has started.</p>

<h2 id="in-process">In Process</h2>

<p>My first computer science course at UHM was ICS111, which was challenging for me to understand the basic concepts of programming languages. Since I didn’t have any experience in this field, it required me to spend countless hours getting familiar with it. After taking several courses, I got interested in C language and C++ programming, especially because I could develop the program precisely and clearly. Spending around four weeks this spring semester taking ICS314, HTML/CSS is another new task to pursue. I expect to broaden my knowledge of programming by cooperating with other people and developing communication skills this semester.</p>

<h2 id="beyond">Beyond</h2>

<p>Looking back at what I have had and learned so far, I don’t think that simply getting a job is the ultimate goal for me. I learned biology regarding neuroscience when I was in Korea majoring in psychology. Even though psychology was a BA degree in past college, I could get into the biology field as well. With the influence of my parents running their own real estate business, it has been a great opportunity to learn about economics and statistics in the real world. Based on those valuable experiences I acquired, I’m looking forward to having experience as a software engineer after graduation to keep developing my programming skills, especially in backend development.</p>
